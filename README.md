# AIQ VeriStressGT Formalization

Lean 4 formalization of the theorems underlying the UCLA **VeriStressGT** (neural-network
robustness-verification stress test) TA1 evaluation card. Structure mirrors the sibling
[`aiq-dkps-formalization`](../aiq-dkps-formalization): one top-level Lean library per
certificate family, a paper-agnostic `ForMathlib` staging library, a
`formalization.yaml`, and prose transcriptions of every source under [`prose/`](prose/).

> 🧭 **New here — especially AI agents — start with [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md).** It
> codifies *why* this exists (formalizing MAGNET evaluation cards), the key structural
> fact (VeriStressGT is a *certificate factory* — many small theorems, not one), the
> published-theorem chain, the working conventions, and the known traps. This README is
> just the build + library map.

> **Status: proved & axiom-clean — `lake build` green, ZERO `sorry`.** Every substantive
> theorem is proved; an independent `#print axioms` sweep over all **62 audited declarations**
> ([`AxiomAudit.lean`](AxiomAudit.lean) / [`scripts/check.sh`](scripts/check.sh)) shows only
> `{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}`.
>
> **What "proved" means here (scope, read before citing):** what is machine-checked is the
> *published certificate theorems* — the T1–T6 templates each construction instantiates, plus,
> for some constructions, the derivation of the sensitivity constant from construction-level
> quantities (see the per-construction status below). This is **not** a proof that each *shipped*
> instance is certifiably robust; on the contrary, the exercise surfaced two machine-checked ways
> the shipped pipeline departs from a sound certificate (the two findings below). Concretely:
> `linearDominance_robust_derived` closes the ideal certificate for the linear construction with
> no assumed constant; the CNN certificate (`dccnn_robust_via_net_upper`) is proved for the ideal
> `L` *modulo an explicit upper-bound hypothesis* the shipped power-iteration `L̂` does not meet
> (edge `dccnn-L-power-iter`); the fixed-pattern chain is assembled with the per-token weights the
> one remaining seam.

## What VeriStressGT claims

Every generated instance is **UNSAT (provably robust) by construction**: each
construction instantiates a published robustness theorem so that
`margin(x₀) > (Lipschitz/sensitivity constant) · ε ⟹ no adversarial example in the L∞
ε-box`. The instance is exported as an `(ONNX, VNN-LIB)` pair, and the card
(`../../ta1/VeriStressGT/cards/evaluation.yaml`) asks the verifier **α-β-CROWN** to
re-derive the UNSAT verdict on **≥ 60%** of instances within a **60 s** timeout. So the
*ground-truth certificate* is a theorem; the *card claim* is an empirical verifier stress
test. See [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) §3 and [`prose/README.md`](prose/README.md) for the
full published-theorem chain.

## Libraries

| Library | Role | Key declarations |
|---|---|---|
| `ForMathlib` | Paper-agnostic staging: operator-norm Lipschitz, softmax-Jacobian bound, IBP steps | `lipschitz_affine_of_opNorm`, `softmax_jacobian_opNorm_le_half`, `ibp_affine_sound`, `ibp_relu_sound` |
| `LipschitzMargin` | T1/T1′ — scalar Lipschitz-margin certificate + spectral-norm composition | `robust_of_margin_gt`, `argmax_stable_of_margin_gt`, `dccnn_robust_of_true_L`, `dccnn_robust_of_upper_bound` |
| `SelfAttention` | T2 — attention `L_attn` sensitivity | `linearDominance_token_bound`, `linearDominance_robust`, `gap_implies_stability_margin`, `fixedPattern_robust` |
| `IntervalBounds` | T4 — interval bound propagation soundness | `Layer`, `netEval`, `netProp`, `ibp_network_sound`, `robust_of_ibp_lower_pos` |
| `ExactMILP` | T3 — big-M ReLU encoding faithfulness + label soundness | `bigM_relu_faithful`, `label_sound_of_optimal` |
| `AlgebraicBoundary` | T6 — distance-to-the-algebraic-boundary certificate | `robust_of_lt_dist_boundary`, `robust_of_numerical_lower_bound` |
| `Verifier` | T5 — CROWN/β-CROWN sound/complete *specification* the card stands on | `VerifierSpec`, `Sound`, `CompleteInLimit`, `sound_unsat_robust` |

There is **no single capstone** (unlike DKPS/DRSB): VeriStressGT is many independent
per-construction certificates. Each `<Library>/Basic.lean` docstring cites the prose file
+ printed theorem number every declaration corresponds to; each library's `README.md`
gives its construction crosswalk.

## Layout

```text
.
├── ForMathlib.lean / ForMathlib/     # DV-free reusable results (import: Mathlib only)
├── <Library>.lean / <Library>/       # one library per certificate family (import: Mathlib + ForMathlib)
├── Challenge/ + comparator/          # Mathlib-candidate comparator package (softmax) — see Challenge/README.md
├── prose/                            # faithful transcriptions of every source theorem

```

The planning products (`theorem-map.md`, `ucla-formalization-edges.md`, `prose/`) are the
pre-Lean layer: they identify the published theorems, transcribe their core argument
chains, and draw the edges to the empirical repo `../../ta1/VeriStressGT/`.

## Build

Toolchain `leanprover/lean4:v4.31.0-rc2`; Mathlib pinned in `lake-manifest.json` (same
rev as the DKPS repo — this repo's `.lake/packages` may be symlinked to it to reuse the
build).

```bash
bash setup_lean.sh      # elan + the pinned toolchain
lake exe cache get      # download prebuilt Mathlib oleans (or reuse the sibling build)
lake build              # builds green (zero `sorry`; see scripts/check.sh)
```

Check a single file fast (no build lock): `lake env lean LipschitzMargin/Basic.lean`.

## Next steps

Both audit gaps (F2 including the softmax bound, and F4b) are landed; the DKPS-style comparator
package now ships ([`Challenge/`](Challenge/README.md) — the softmax candidate: `def softmax` +
`hasFDerivAt_softmax` + `lipschitzWith_softmax` + the Loewner Jacobian bounds); and the prior-art
pass removed the one redundant local lemma in favour of Mathlib's `LipschitzWith.list_prod`
(`netLipschitz` now calls it directly). The remaining work is non-Lean adjudication and outside
review.

1. **Adjudicate the `n/4` pooling (F2-C.3, edge `attn-Lattn-n4-pooling`):** locate the halving
   argument in Kim et al. (arXiv:2006.04710) — if none exists, this is a confirmed Family-A
   soundness bug in `compute_L_attn` (certified `L_attn` ~2× too small, unsafe direction).
   `pooling_leading_coeff` records the honest `n/2`.
2. **External review** of statement faithfulness to the PDFs — the concrete asks are in
   [`AUDIT.md`](AUDIT.md) §5 step 7.
3. **Optional (`float32-export`, R9):** adopt `girving/interval` if the float-soundness edge is
   prioritized ([`EXTERNAL-LEAN-SURVEY.md`](EXTERNAL-LEAN-SURVEY.md) §A).

Reproduce the verification story at any time with [`scripts/check.sh`](scripts/check.sh)
(build + no-sorry + axiom audit).
